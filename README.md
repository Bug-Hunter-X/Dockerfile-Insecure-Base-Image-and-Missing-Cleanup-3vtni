# Dockerfile Bug: Insecure Base Image and Missing Cleanup

This repository demonstrates a common mistake in Dockerfiles: using a large, insecure base image (`ubuntu:latest`) and failing to clean up after package installation.

**Bug:**
The provided `Dockerfile` uses `ubuntu:latest`, which is oversized and vulnerable to potential security risks due to its frequent updates. Additionally, it lacks the `apt-get clean` and `apt-get autoremove` commands to remove unused packages and dependencies after installation, leading to larger image sizes.

**Solution:**
The `Dockerfile_solution` replaces `ubuntu:latest` with a smaller, more secure, and optimized base image. It also includes cleanup steps to improve the image size and reduce vulnerabilities.  Consider using a minimal image tailored to your specific needs and dependencies.
